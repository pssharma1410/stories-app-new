Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system. The entire development environment is containerized, so no local Python or database installation is required.

Docker: Installation Guide

Docker Compose: Installation Guide

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project configured on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

2. Configure Environment Variables
The project uses a .env file to manage secrets and configuration. To create your local configuration, simply copy the provided example file. The default values are already configured to work with the Docker setup.

cp .env.example .env

This file contains the database credentials, Django secret key, and other settings needed for the application to run.

Running the Application
With the setup complete, you can build and launch the entire application stack.

1. Start All Services
Use the Makefile command to build the Docker images and start the web, worker, db, and redis services.

make dev

Alternatively, you can use the direct docker-compose command:

docker-compose up --build

The application will now be running and accessible at http://localhost:8000.

2. Initial Database Migrations (Automatic)
The start.sh script, which runs when the web container starts, automatically applies any pending database migrations. You don't need to run this manually on the first startup.

3. Create a Superuser
To access the Django admin panel, you must create a superuser account. Open a new terminal window in the project root and run:

make superuser

Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password. You can then log in to the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin/.

Available Commands
The Makefile provides convenient shortcuts for common development and maintenance tasks.

Command

Description

make dev

Builds and starts all Docker containers in detached mode.

make migrate

Manually runs Django database migrations on the web service.

make superuser

Creates a new Django admin superuser account.

make worker

Starts a new Celery worker instance for debugging purposes.

make lint

Runs the flake8 linter to check for Python code style issues.

make test

Runs the project's test suite using pytest.

Stopping the Application
To stop and remove all running containers, network, and volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml, run:

docker-compose down

To stop the containers without removing them, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker-compose up is running, or use docker-compose stop.
